<p>The issue with the small, fixed LED IR cameras is the plastic utilized in front of the lens and in some cases, the actual lens. After a couple of years in the harsher environments, this plastic tends to fade and end up being milky. This makes it difficult for the CCD or CMOS sensing unit to successfully equate the images, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can trigger a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Inside, these devices have a far longer life expectancy, but outdoors, or perhaps in a garage without environment control, much of them lose their sharpness and clarity succumbing to the severe environment.</p>
<p>Fixed-mount security cameras are non-discriminating in what they tape; whatever within their focus ability is caught. That is to state, CCTV cameras are pretty un-focused when it concerns isolating the images of an active event about to happen. But you can't buy this camera on its own-- you need to contribute to a full Vivint home security system. </p>
