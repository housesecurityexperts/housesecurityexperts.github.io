<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is good but not great-- and so it isn't worth paying twice the rate of its predecessor. When the 2 are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper throughout day and nighttime watching. However, color night vision image quality is frustrating, and the motion tracking feature is a bit wonky. Likewise, the Pro 3 offers no totally free storage, and external storage can't be seen through the app, only through a computer. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, however for now, we still believe the Arlo Pro 2 is a much better buy. Both are still much better than the costly Arlo Ultra, which we discovered to have dreadful night-vision performance, poor battery life, and a propensity to miss out on far too many motion activates.</p>

We suggest cellular systems since they're far more secure than landline systems, but there are some places where cellular monitoring isn't readily available. A landline system is still much better than no security at all if you live somewhere without access to cellular monitoring.</p>
