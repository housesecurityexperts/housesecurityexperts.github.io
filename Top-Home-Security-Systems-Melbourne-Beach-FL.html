<p>Unlike conventional burglar alarms, which have a control panel (generally located in the entryway hall) that is used to equip and deactivate the alarm and alert you if any sensing units have actually been triggered, clever alarms are controlled from a smartphone app. The app lets you arm and disarm the alarm, even if you have actually already left home, and informs you if any of the sensing units have actually been set off, rather than getting home to find your siren has actually been sounding all afternoon (and possibly bothersome your neighbours).

<p>But monitored systems also tend to have a service contract, which locks you into paying an often-pricey month-to-month charge for a set quantity of time, typically one to 5 years.
