This implies that customers have plenty to choose from.</p>
<p>Lighting: Many security cameras have the ability to shoot in what is called "low-light infrared," allowing them to record clear video footage in dark conditions. These cameras depend on infrared LED lights, which cover the dark area in infrared light.
