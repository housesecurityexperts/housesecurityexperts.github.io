<h3>Monitored Home Security Systems in Georgia</h3>
<p>Thank you for your feedback, Don. We've found that battery life never ever matches the maker's stats considering that this originates from tests in a controlled environment without constant video recording, which is the biggest culprit for brief battery life by far. We concur with you about Blink's remarkable battery life over on our outdoor security camera review, however its recording capability is a bit restricted to recommend as a top pick.</p>
<p>Throughout our screening, this compact camera recorded sharp, 1080p HD images day and night, and its digital zoom worked for taking a closer look. We particularly like this camera's broad, 180-degree field of vision, due to the fact that you're less most likely to get a blind area any place you set it up. For less than $400, you get two door and window sensing units, one motion detector, and a video doorbell with two-way talk.</p>

<p>Moreover they can not send fluid video, only still frame images or low resolution snippets of video.
