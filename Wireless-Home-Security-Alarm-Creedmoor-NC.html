<p>Although 1080p is typically the standard resolution for cameras we have actually evaluated, there are advantages to models with higher-resolution sensing units. Few home security cameras have optical zoom lenses, but almost all have digital zoom, which crop and expand whatever the camera is recording. The more megapixels a camera sensor has, the more you can digitally zoom in and still have the ability to see things plainly.</p>
