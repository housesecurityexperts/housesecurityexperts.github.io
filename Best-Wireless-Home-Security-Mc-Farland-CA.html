<p>Commercial-grade cameras fix this problem with a special light-handling feature. These cameras use both a software application and hardware option called HDR, which represent High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the room and a direct exposure of the doorway and then integrates the 2 images together to produce a properly-exposed composite image of the two locations. As far as anybody is concerned, the image looks completely regular because the entrance and room seem at the exact same brightness level. As a result, faces are effectively exposed at the door and in the shop, achieving the goal of recording video of everyone going into the store. HDR is now a standard feature in commercial cameras. Regrettably, as soon as consumers realize that the affordable consumer camera they purchased is lacking HDR, it's generally too late considering that the cameras and recorders are installed.</p>
<p>Like the Nest Webcam IQ Indoor, this design has Familiar Face informs, which can determine people the camera is finding using face recognition. When it identifies an individual in the frame, it will ask whether you understand that individual and if so to tag them by name. After a while, the camera will discover to determine those people and will send smartphone signals with that details when they appear at your home. We believe this feature (which needs a Nest Aware subscription) is more rewarding outdoors, where you are most likely to wish to differentiate anticipated visitors from random complete strangers. We also found the feature to be more reputable on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ model (on the indoor model, this function was always asking us to recognize faces on a close-by TELEVISION). Three microphones (versus the Nest Camera Outdoor's one) also supply a broader series of audio, so you can much better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
