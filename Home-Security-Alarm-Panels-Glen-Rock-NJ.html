When the magnet is moved far from the reed switch, the reed switch either opens or closes, once again based upon whether the style is generally open or normally closed. This action combined with an electrical current (generally at 12V DC) allows an alarm control panel to identify a fault on that zone or circuit. These type of sensing units are very common and are found either wired straight to an alarm control board, or they can typically be discovered in wireless door or window contacts as sub-components.</p>
