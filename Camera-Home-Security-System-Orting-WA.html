<p>For all the benefits of Nest Secure, the quality of client service is not one of them.

This is a well-designed camera and hub combo, which consists of a long-lasting battery, and which is readily available at a good cost.

<p>Like the Nest Camera IQ Indoor, this model has Familiar Face alerts, which can recognize individuals the camera is finding utilizing face recognition. When it identifies a person in the frame, it will ask whether you know that individual and if so to tag them by name. After a while, the camera will learn to identify those individuals and will send out smartphone signals with that info when they show up at your home. We believe this feature (which requires a Nest Aware subscription) is more worthwhile outdoors, where you are most likely to wish to identify predicted visitors from random complete strangers. We also discovered the function to be more dependable on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ design (on the indoor model, this feature was always asking us to identify faces on a close-by TELEVISION). 3 microphones (versus the Nest Camera Outdoor's one) also provide a broader series of audio, so you can much better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
