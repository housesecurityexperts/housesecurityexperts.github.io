<p>What really sets this model apart is Nest Aware, a subscription service that can be expensive but is necessary. In reality, we don't suggest purchasing this camera at all unless you plan to include the membership. Without it, you will not get the person-detection function, personalized Activity Zones (which let you monitor designated areas within the camera's field of vision), or Sightline, a comprehensive, scrollable timeline of when and where the camera found activity. Having the ability to distinguish between an individual and an automobile, for instance, permits you to reduce unneeded notifies. And Activity Zones are a good perk, specifically if you're wanting to monitor a particular corner of the lawn, an entrance, or even trash bin. </p>
