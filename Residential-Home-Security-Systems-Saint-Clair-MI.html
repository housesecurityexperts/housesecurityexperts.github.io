It has a close-up tracking function, which automatically focuses on motion and then follows it around the field of view.

<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is the among the best tools for watching over your home. Its wire-free style, high-resolution video, and budget friendly cloud monitoring assist it stand above the competition.
