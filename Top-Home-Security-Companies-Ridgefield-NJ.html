The latter allows you to see precisely when a specific person gets to the house - so you'll when the kids got home from school and if they were alone, and whether the cleaner showed up on time.

Although FrontPoint offers a wide array of equipment and home automation products at a sensible price, the one location where the company particularly stands out remains in Do It Yourself installation. </p>
