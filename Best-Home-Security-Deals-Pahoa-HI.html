<p>When selecting a home security camera is whether you require an indoor or outdoor  camera, the other major decision. Outdoor cameras will typically be constructed to be more able and durable to survive rain, frost, or damp.

And if you want to save 4K videos, it's an additional $1.99 per camera each month, on top of the month-to-month plan, the latter of which is waived for the very first year. But if you want the absolute best when it pertains to video quality, the Arlo Ultra has it.</p>
