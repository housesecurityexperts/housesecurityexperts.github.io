<p>A number of other designs were disqualified due to performance concerns. We had issues with the app for the Honeywell Home C2, which was also afflicted with fuzzy night vision and left spaces (5 seconds to 10 seconds) in between 30-second clips. The Logitech Circle 2 (cordless) kept us waiting (as much as 30 seconds) to connect to a live peek, often buffered, and had a reset function that left gaps of as much as 90 seconds in between videos.</p>
<p>The problem with the small, set LED IR cameras is the plastic used in front of the lens and in some cases, the real lens. After a few years in the harsher climates, this plastic tends to fade and end up being milky. This makes it challenging for the CCD or CMOS sensing unit to effectively translate the imagery, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can cause a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Inside your home, these gadgets have a far longer life expectancy, however outdoors, or perhaps in a garage without environment control, a number of them lose their sharpness and clearness succumbing to the harsh environment.</p>
