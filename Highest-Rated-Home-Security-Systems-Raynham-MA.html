<p>Six basic CCTV security camera technologies exist in todays CCTV surveillance markets. In a network injection attack, a hacker can utilize access points that are exposed to non-filtered network traffic, specifically relaying network traffic such as Spanning Tree" (802.1 D), OSPF, RIP, and HSRP The hacker injects bogus networking re-configuration commands that affect routers, switches, and smart centers.

<p>The DoS attack in itself does little to expose organizational data to a destructive aggressor, considering that the disruption of the network prevents the circulation of data and really indirectly secures data by preventing it from being transmitted. The normal reason for performing a DoS attack is to observe the healing of the wireless network, throughout which all of the preliminary handshake codes are re-transmitted by all devices, offering an opportunity for the destructive enemy to record these codes and utilize numerous cracking tools to examine security weak points and exploit them to get unauthorized access to the system. This works best on weakly encrypted systems such as WEP, where there are a variety of tools offered which can release a dictionary style attack of "possibly accepted" security keys based on the "design" security key recorded during the network healing.</p>
