<p>Like the Nest Cam IQ Indoor, this design has Familiar Face notifies, which can determine individuals the camera is finding using face recognition. When it finds an individual in the frame, it will ask whether you know that individual and if so to tag them by name. After a while, the camera will learn to determine those people and will send smart device informs with that info when they show up at your home. We think this function (which needs a Nest Aware membership) is more beneficial outdoors, where you are more likely to want to differentiate expected visitors from random complete strangers. We also discovered the feature to be more trustworthy on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ model (on the indoor design, this feature was constantly asking us to identify faces on a close-by TELEVISION). Three microphones (versus the Nest Cam Outdoor's one) also provide a wider variety of audio, so you can much better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
