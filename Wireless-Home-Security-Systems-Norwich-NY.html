<p>Frontpoint provides 5 packages and 2 monitoring plans: Interactive and Ultimate. Our tester opted for the Interactive strategy but ended up disappointed with its lack of live video surveillance.

<p>The problem with the small, fixed LED IR cameras is the plastic utilized in front of the lens and in some cases, the real lens. After a couple of years in the harsher climates, this plastic tends to fade and end up being milky. This makes it challenging for the CCD or CMOS sensor to successfully equate the images, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can cause a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Inside, these gadgets have a far longer life span, however outdoors, or even in a garage without environment control, many of them lose their sharpness and clarity succumbing to the severe environment.</p>
<p>We also enjoy that Ring still has good wise home support. Some other cheap security systems, like SimpliSafe and Cove, do not work so well with wise home gadgets like locks and lights. Ring Alarm supports Z-Wave, so you can incorporate your clever outlets with your overall security system. Wireless keypads and keychains so you can manage your alarm system from anywhere inside or near your business. </p>
