Overall, Brinks Home Security offers a quality item for a decent rate in a congested market.</p>

<p>The issue with the small, fixed LED IR cameras is the plastic used in front of the lens and in many cases, the real lens. After a couple of years in the harsher climates, this plastic tends to fade and end up being milky. This makes it tough for the CCD or CMOS sensor to effectively equate the imagery, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can trigger a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Indoors, these gadgets have a far longer life expectancy, however outdoors, or even in a garage without climate control, many of them lose their sharpness and clarity succumbing to the harsh environment.</p>
