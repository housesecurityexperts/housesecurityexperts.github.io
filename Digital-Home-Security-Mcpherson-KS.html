<h3>Home Security Alarm System in Kansas</h3>
<p>Thank you for your feedback, Don.

We concur with you about Blink's exceptional battery life over on our outdoor security camera evaluation, however its recording capacity is a bit minimal to suggest as a top pick.</p>
<p>Every alarm user shall obtain an Alarm User Permit for each alarm system within the Village. Alarm Authorizations are acquired from the Cops Department or the application can be downloaded here, and are authorized by the Town Administrator. Any alarm user who operates an alarm system without very first obtaining a license, or who, after having an authorization revoked or suspended, fails to detach the alarm, will remain in violation.</p>

<p>The Blink XT2 is small, runs on 2 AA batteries, and includes a year's worth of complimentary cloud storage, and it captures a much better image and longer clips than its predecessors. So why isn't it a pick? It still leaves a minimum of 11 seconds in between recordings, smart device alerts and live views were painfully sluggish, and the range is bad. Also, if the camera remains in the middle of recording, do not anticipate to get a live peek or make any settings modifications-- it can't multitask.</p>
