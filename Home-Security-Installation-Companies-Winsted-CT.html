<p>A number of other models were disqualified due to efficiency problems. We had issues with the app for the Honeywell Home C2, which was likewise pestered with fuzzy night vision and left gaps (5 seconds to 10 seconds) in between 30-second clips.

<p>The problem with the small, fixed LED IR cameras is the plastic used in front of the lens and in some cases, the real lens. After a couple of years in the harsher climates, this plastic tends to fade and become milky. This makes it difficult for the CCD or CMOS sensor to effectively equate the imagery, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can trigger a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Indoors, these devices have a far longer life expectancy, but outdoors, or perhaps in a garage without climate control, much of them lose their sharpness and clearness catching the extreme environment.</p>
<p>Equipment consists of things like your door and window sensors, motion sensing units, control panel, etc. The cost completely depends on which provider you select, however expect to pay a few hundred dollars for a basic package--$ 200 would be thought about cheap for a starter pack of home security equipment. That stated, it can run more affordable if you opt for a company that runs a lot of deals on equipment (like Frontpoint). </p>
