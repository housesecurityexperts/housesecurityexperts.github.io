<p>The cover of darkness isn't enough to keep this late night lurker's identity hidden from Arlo's view. The one time where lag does end up being a little a problem is in between discovering and taping motion. Because the Pro 2 does not do continuous video recording, it takes a second for the camera to really turn on when it spots motion. They might get past the camera prior to it had time to tape-record them if a nefarious crook was quickly enough.</p>
