This meant every door and window required its own wire and course of holes through your house.</p>

<p>Commercial-grade cameras solve this issue with an unique light-handling feature. These cameras utilize both a software and hardware solution called HDR, which represent High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the room and an exposure of the entrance and then combines the 2 images together to develop a properly-exposed composite picture of the two areas. As far as anybody is worried, the image looks totally typical given that the doorway and room appear to be at the exact same brightness level. As a result, faces are correctly exposed at the door and in the store, accomplishing the goal of catching video of everybody getting in the shop. HDR is now a standard feature in commercial cameras. Sadly, once consumers understand that the inexpensive customer camera they bought is lacking HDR, it's usually far too late considering that the recorders and cameras are set up.</p>
