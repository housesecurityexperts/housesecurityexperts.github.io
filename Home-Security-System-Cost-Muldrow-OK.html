<p>Your CCTV camera might make you feel physically much safer, however after reading this post, it will sure make you feel virtually susceptible. On the easier side, with SimpliSafe, you trade the bells and whistles of clever home equipment for flexibility and low prices. SimpliSafe does have a video doorbell with two-way audio, but you can't add a ton of other smart home tech to the system. It won't work with loads of smart home equipment from other companies. The app is extremely outstanding, and while the level of control does not match SmartThings, developing 'Actions' - such as turning the hall light on when you open the front door, or showing up the heat when you trip the motion sensor in the morning - are refreshingly easy.</p>
