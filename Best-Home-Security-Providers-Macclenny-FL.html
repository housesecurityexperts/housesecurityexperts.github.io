<p>I explained that all we would need to do is take advantage of any among the emergency call buttons, input into the Axis camera, which also consisted of two-way audio, and that camera would end up being the interface into the VMS system. When a client presses the emergency situation button, it sends out double signals: one to the nurse calling station and the other to the central patient-monitoring command center, through the VMS. Additionally, if the main patient-monitoring command center received a motion detection alarm, suggesting that a high-risk patient left her bed, the patient-monitoring operator would assess the threat and, if required, might merely press an onscreen button to call the nursing station on that specific flooring.</p>

<p>Just recently, Ring denied reports that it had actually suffered a data breach, however we agree with its recommendation that users should reset passwords and make it possible for two-factor authentication as a precautionary measure. All smart-home devices are susceptible to such events. Nevertheless, after this latest entry in a year-long series of questionable media reports, we have decided to pull our recommendation of Ring's video doorbells. If you prepare to pair the Ring Alarm with any of Ring's video doorbells or cameras, please first read the What about Ring? section from our wise video doorbell guide. While our company believe Ring's defects are a dealbreaker when it comes to video products, we do not believe that these issues change the performance and user experience of the Ring Alarm, so we remain confident in our existing recommendation.</p>
