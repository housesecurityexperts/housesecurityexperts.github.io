<p>Due to the fact that it's more complicated than it should be, we don't advise the SmartThings SmartCam. Recordings, notifies, and combination all need different IFTTT-style rules. Recordings are captured as 10-second clips that are saved for up to 24 hours, unless you pay the $8 month-to-month cost (or $80 per year) to keep 30-second clips for 1 month.
