<p>Commercial-grade cameras fix this issue with a special light-handling function. These cameras utilize both a software and hardware service called HDR, which mean High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the space and a direct exposure of the entrance and then combines the 2 images together to develop a properly-exposed composite image of the 2 areas. As far as anybody is concerned, the image looks totally normal because the entrance and space seem at the same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are appropriately exposed at the door and in the store, achieving the objective of catching video of everybody entering the store.

Nevertheless, you might pick to NOT have your cameras monitored by the Central Station (this is typically done for cameras that are monitoring indoor, houses). Cameras that are not monitored by the central station can not be accessed our operators for any factor, even if requested by the customer. </p>
