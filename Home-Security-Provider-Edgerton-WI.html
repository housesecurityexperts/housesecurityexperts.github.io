<p>Unlike conventional alarm systems, which have a control board (usually positioned in the entrance hall) that is used to deactivate the alarm and arm and alert you if any sensors have been triggered, smart alarms are controlled from a mobile phone app. The app lets you arm and deactivate the alarm, even if you have actually currently left home, and alerts you if any of the sensing units have been triggered, instead of getting home to find your siren has been sounding all afternoon (and potentially irritating your neighbours). Nevertheless, wise alarms do require a hub that allows the different components to wirelessly link. However for the majority of wise alarms this hub can be put anywhere in your home.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, in any situation where standard-definition video cameras are utilized, the quality is going to be poor since the maximum pixel resolution of the image chips in the majority of these gadgets is 320,000 pixels (analogue quality is determined in TV lines but the results are the very same); they usually capture horizontal and vertical fields of lines and blend them together to make a single frame; the optimum frame rate is usually 30 frames per second.</p>
<p>In addition they can not transfer fluid video, only still frame images or low resolution bits of video. Blink Security Cameras are a good example of a system we are constantly assisting customers replace. As experts in the market our guidance is to stay away.
